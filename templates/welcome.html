<h2>Welcome to the Valuation Game!</h2>
<p>In this game, your group will be deciding the price on every week during {{ nperiods }} consecutive weeks.
In every week, a random number of customers will show up to buy. Each customer has a valuation and will buy if
    their valuation is above the selling price.</p>
<p> Your objective is to choose prices that maximize the total revenue over the selling period. </p>
