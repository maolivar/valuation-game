<h2>Welcome to the Valuation Game!</h2>
<p>In this game, your group will be deciding the price on every week during {{ nperiods }} consecutive weeks.
In every week, a random number of customers will show up to buy. Each customer has a valuation and will buy if
    their valuation is above the selling price.</p>
<p> Your objective is to choose prices that maximize the total revenue over the selling period. </p>

{% if has_inv %}
    <p> In this game scenario, you start with an initial inventory of {{ inv }}, to be used through all the {{ nperiods }} weeks. </p>
{% endif %}

{% if not valuetype == 'full' %}
    <p> Customer valuations change across weeks, with customers with low and high valuations.
        During the {{ nperiods }} weeks, valuations on each week are: {{ value_list }} </p>
{% endif %}
